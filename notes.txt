When the API recives a call at /player/:queuid 

1. I check if the user is in my database.
    1.a It exists in my database, I return what I have.

    1.b It does not exist in my database.
        1.1.A. I make a query regarding that account and if it exists, I make another one that brings the last 20 matches of that user and I save that info in the database.

    1.C The following stats can be 0 when the user has not played any recent match in a ranked queue, but it has a league:
        "AverageKDA": 0,
        "AverageCSPerMinute": 0,
        "AverageVisionScore": 0

2. The logic for recent matches is the same. If the user exists, I return what I have, in case it does not exist, I look for it in the LOL API.

3. The leaderboard only shows those users that have a rank for the requested league. That is to say that if you hit the endpoint /leaderboard/420, it will bring only the users that comply to have a league currently in Solo Queue, otherwise, they are not considered at all in the leaderboard.

4. I hope you like it and that it meets your expectations!
