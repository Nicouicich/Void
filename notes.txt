When I am asked for information about a user, I do the following:

1. I check if that user is in my database.
    1.a It exists in my database, I return what I have.
    1.b It does not exist in my database.
        1.1.A. I make a query regarding that account and if it exists, I make another one that brings the last 20 matches of that user and I save that info in the database.

2. The logic for recent matches is the same. If the user exists, I return what I have, in case it does not exist, I look for it in the LOL API.

3. The leaderboard only shows those users that have a rank for the requested league. That is to say that if you hit the endpoint /leaderboard/420, it will bring only the users that comply to have a league currently in Solo Queue, otherwise, they are not considered at all in the leaderboard.

4. I hope you like it and that it meets your expectations!
